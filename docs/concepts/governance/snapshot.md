# Snapshot

## Overview

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), a spinoff of Balancer, is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

Snapshot derives its name from taking a "snapshot" of the Ethereum blockchain at a certain block number before voting opens. By having a fixed point in time, this eliminates the need to worry about moving tokens voting multiple times or someone using a flash loan to borrow a ton of voting power. 

## Eligibility/How to Vote

In order to be eligible to [vote on Balancer](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer) proposals, you need satisfy at least one of the following:

* Hold BAL tokens
* Hold BPT tokens for pools that have BAL in them
* Have someone delegate their voting power to your address

When a vote opens, click on the proposal in the Balancer Space, scroll to the voting section, and cast your vote. Your wallet provider will ask you to sign a message \(don't worry, you won't be charged any gas\).
