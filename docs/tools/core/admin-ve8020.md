## Instructions for use of this tool:

### Step 1 - Create BPT with your token
To create a Vote Escrow system, you will need a Balancer Pool Token (BPT) that is to be locked. Use your pool token address in this tool as "Locked Token Address". For more information on Deploying Balancer Pools, [see this guide](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/more/deployments.html).

### Step 2 - Deploy Voting Escrow System
Use this Admin panel with the admin wallet to create your VE system. For direct access to contracts, see [this guide](/reference/vote-escrow-launchpad/1_launchpad). 

### Step 3 - Add Your Own Reward Program
Use the "Rewards Distribution" tab to set Reward Token and permisssions. For more detailed information see [Reward Distributor Guide](/reference/vote-escrow-launchpad/3_RewardDistributor) and the [Reward Faucet Guide](/reference/vote-escrow-launchpad/4_RewardFaucet)
