# Flash Loans

## Overview

Since the Vault holds all tokens for all pools, the consolidated token balances are available as Flash Loans.

## Example Code

```clike
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "@balancer-labs/v2-vault/contracts/interfaces/IVault.sol";
import "@balancer-labs/v2-vault/contracts/interfaces/IFlashLoanRecipient.sol";

contract FlashLoanRecipient is IFlashLoanRecipient {
    IVault private constant vault = "0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8";

    function makeFlashLoan(
        IERC20[] memory tokens,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external {
      vault.flashLoan(this, tokens, amounts, userData);
    }

    function receiveFlashLoan(
        IERC20[] memory tokens,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        uint256[] memory feeAmounts,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external override {
        require(msg.sender == vault);
        ...
    }
}
```
